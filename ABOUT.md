#### Virtual Biotic Pollination Flow App

Nations’ food consumption patterns are increasingly globalized and trade dependent.
Natural resources used for agriculture (e.g. water, pollinators) are hence being virtually
exchanged across countries. Inspired by the virtual water concept, we herein propose the concept
of virtual biotic pollination flow as an indicator of countries’ mutual dependence on biodiversity-
based ecosystem services. Using information on 55 pollinator-dependent crop markets (2001-
2015), we show that richer countries demand high levels of biodiversity-based services to sustain
their consumption patterns. Such patterns are supported by importation of virtual biotic
pollination (up to 40% of national imports of pollinator-dependent crops) from developing
countries, stimulating cropland expansion. Quantifying virtual pollination flow can help develop
new global socio-economic policies to meet the interconnected challenges of biodiversity loss,
ecosystem health, and social justice.
