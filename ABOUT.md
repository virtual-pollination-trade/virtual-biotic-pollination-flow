#### Virtual Biotic Pollination Flow App

Countriesâ€™ consumption pattern is increasingly more globalized, depending more on importations for
access to basic and luxury products. Natural resources used for food production (e.g. water, soil
nutrients, pollinators) are hence being virtually exchanged across countries. Inspired on the well-known
concepts of virtual water and land flow, we propose the concept of virtual biotic pollination flow as an
indicator of how countries are mutually dependent on their biodiversity-based ecosystem services.
Using information on 53 pollinator-dependent crop markets between 2001 and 2015, we show that more
developed countries demand higher levels of biodiversity to sustain their consumption patterns. Such
patterns are supported by importations of virtual biotic pollination from less-developed countries, which
is driving crop land expansion (the main driver of deforestation and biodiversity loss). These results
emphasize the need for international coordination to protect pollinators and may help develop global
economic tools to support conservation policies aiming to protect biodiversity.
